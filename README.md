# PMD Lua-Mod Loader

A loader for Lua based mods for Gates to Infinity and Super Mystery Dungeon.  Includes Free-Cam and other sample mods.
There are limitations to what can be done from Lua scripts, but there are still many interesting things to do.

### Installation:
 
#### Luma3DS LayeredFS
Make sure to [enable game patching](https://github.com/AuroraWright/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features).
place the "RomFS" folder in the "luma/titles/0004000000174600" folder on your 3DS SD card for Super or "luma/titles/00040000000BA800" for Gates (you may have to create one of more these folders).  
  
#### Citra Packed ROM
Unpack your game ROM using your desired tool/kit (eg .Net 3DS Toolkit).  Merge the mod loader's "RomFS" folder with that extracted from the ROM, overwriting files when prompted.  Repack ROM and load with Citra.  
&nbsp;  
  
### Use:
Hold the 'L' or 'X' button while opening the "Others" menu to open the mod loader menu.  Select the desired entry from the list, and press 'A' to run.  If only one mod is available, it will be loaded directly.
